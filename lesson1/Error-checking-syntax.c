/*
Most of the words in the code use all lowercase letters. This is known as case-sensitivity. Whether lowercase or 
uppercase, certain words in the code must follow the correct case in order for the code to run. The only lines of text 
that can change case are the comment and the text between quotes.

The Semicolon
All statements, like the printf() statement, need to end with a semicolon. This identifies the end of the statement and 
is needed for the code to run correctly.

Double Quotes
The text in between the double quotes " is known as a string (think of a string of characters). All strings must be 
surrounded by double-quotes.
