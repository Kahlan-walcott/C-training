Every program we’ve seen so far has only had one possible path of execution — they all execute line by line, from top to
bottom. And every time you run one of those programs, it gives you the same exact result. But it’s the twenty-first
century, and we like options!

In this lesson, we will introduce logic into our code and explore how programs make decisions by evaluating conditions!

We’ll be covering the following concepts:

if, else if, and else statements
switch statements
Relational and Logical operators
Ternary operators
So… if you’ve already learned these concepts in another language, go to the next lesson — else.
