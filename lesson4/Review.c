/*
Congratulations on completing the lesson on conditionals! ðŸ™Œ

Letâ€™s review some of the major concepts from the lesson:

An if statement checks a condition and will execute a task if that condition evaluates to true.
if / else statements make binary decisions and execute different code blocks based on a provided condition.
We can add more conditions using else if statements.
Relational operators, including <, >, <=, >=, ==, and != can compare two values.
Logical operators, including &&, ||, and ! can allow multiple conditions in one conditional statement.
A switch statement can be used to simplify the process of writing multiple else if statements. The break keyword stops
the remaining cases from being checked and executed in a switch statement.
A ternary operator can be used to simplify the process of an if else statement.

/* Optional: Little Mac is an interplanetary space boxer, who is trying to win championship belts for various weight categories on other planets within the solar system.

Write a space.c program that helps him keep track of his target weight by: It should ask him what his earth weight is. Ask him to enter a number for the planet he wants to fight on. It should then compute his weight on the destination planet.

Compile and execute:

gcc space.c
./a.out

Here is the table of conversion:

#	Planet	Relative Gravity
1	Mercury	0.38
2	Venus	0.91
3	Mars	0.38
4	Jupiter	2.34
5	Saturn	1.06
6	Uranus	0.92
7	Neptune	1.19
*/

// ways to do this

/*To compute his weight on the planet he is fighting on, multiply his earth weight and the relative gravity of that planet.
Try using both if, else if , else and a switch statement!
One possible answer: */
