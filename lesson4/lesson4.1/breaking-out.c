/*
When working with loops, it’s important to know a few special keywords that can affect how a loop runs. Let’s look at a
quick example to introduce the first special keyword!

Do you remember the while loop from exercise 3?

while (guess != 8 && tries < 50) {
  printf("Wrong guess, try again: ");
  scanf("%d", &guess);
  tries++;
}

The loop runs until 8 is guessed or 50 attempts have been made to guess the secret number. This means the loop will stop
running as soon as one of those conditions is met. There is another way to write this, but using a special keyword. See
if you can spot it!

while (tries < 50) {
  scanf("%d", &guess);

  if (guess == 8) {
    break;
  }

  printf("Wrong guess, try again: ");
  tries++;
}

The keyword break allows us to, quite literally, “break” out of a loop and stop it from running any more times.

It can often simply be avoided with careful planning of the conditional controlling a loop. It’s generally advised to be
careful with breaking out of loops because it can result in unexpected processing when a programmer has a mental plan
centered around a loop finishing all its iterations.

However, when used effectively, a break can increase the efficiency of a program and help minimize its memory uses
through unnecessary variables.

Note: break is most often used when a program wants to run a loop infinitely in a controlled manner. For example, a
program that runs until the user types “quit.” In that instance, the program may run forever, but will only break out of
its running loop when the user tells it.

#include <stdio.h>

int main() {

  int number1 = 1;
  int numbers_entered1 = 0;

  while (numbers_entered1 < 10) {

    printf("Loop 1 - Please enter a number: ");
    scanf("%d", &number1);

    // Figure out how to break out here!

    numbers_entered1++;
  }

  printf("Good job! You’ve broken out!\n");
}

// fixed

#include <stdio.h>

int main() {

  int number1 = 1;
  int numbers_entered1 = 0;
  int number2 = 1;
  int numbers_entered2 = 0;

  while (numbers_entered1 < 10) {

    printf("Loop 1 - Please enter a number: ");
    scanf("%d", &number1);

    // Figure out how to break out here!
    /* In our program, the while loop will run a set amount of 
    times or until a non-positive number is entered (this includes 
    0 and negative numbers). Without changing the condition of the while 
    loop, try to get it to stop when a non-positive number is entered 
    using the break keyword. */
    if (number1 <= 0) {
      break;
    }
    numbers_entered1++;
  }
  /* You may have noticed the break keyword isn’t necessary here to stop the loop from running.

Create a second while loop below the first one and use the condition 
number2 > 0 && numbers_entered2 < 10, then write the loop as normal 
without any break. Don’t forget to initialize the new variables at the 
top of main.

Run the program again with the second loop, you’ll see both loops act 
the same exact way and stop when a negative number is entered. */
  while (number2 > 0 && numbers_entered2 < 10) {
    printf("Loop 2 - Please enter a number: ");
    scanf("%d", &number1);

    numbers_entered2++;
  }

  printf("Good job! You’ve broken out!\n");
}
