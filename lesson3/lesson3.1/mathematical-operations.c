/*
At their core, computers are basically fancy calculators. So itâ€™s a good thing to learn how to perform basic
mathematical operations early on in your language development.

Addition and subtraction work just as you would expect them to. a = 2 + 3 will store 5 in the variable a. You can also
use these variables as part of the math (or all of it).

int a = 2;
int b = 3;
int c = a + b;

These same foundational principles of mathematics hold true for subtraction, multiplication, and division.
