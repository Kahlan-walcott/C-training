In this lesson you will learn about:

performing basic mathematical operations on variables and values using common symbols.
assigning values to variables and/or performing basic mathematical operations using shorthand operations.
comparing two values and/or variables against each other to return a true/false.
using logical operators (and, or, and not).
In the previous lesson, you learned how to create and set variables, but not what you can do with them beyond that. In
this lesson, you will learn about modifying variables with the power of math, some shorthand assignment methods, and how
to compare variables and values. Finally, we will go over how to use logical operators for “and,” “or,” and “not.”
